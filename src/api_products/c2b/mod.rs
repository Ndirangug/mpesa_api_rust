//!Respresenation of the C2B Api
//! 
//! This API enables Paybill and Buy Goods merchants to integrate to M-Pesa and receive real time payments notifications.
//! Several apis are encapsulated in this:
//! * **Register Url** - The C2B Register URL API registers the 3rd partyâ€™s confirmation and validation URLs to M-Pesa ; which then maps
//!                     these URLs to the 3rd party shortcode. Whenever M-Pesa receives a transaction on the shortcode, M-Pesa triggers
//!                     a validation request against the validation URL and the 3rd party system responds to M-Pesa with a validation
//!                     response (either a success or an error code). The response expected is the success code the 3rd party
//!                     M-Pesa completes or cancels the transaction depending on the validation response it receives from the 3rd party
//!                     system. A confirmation request of the transaction is then sent by M-Pesa through the confirmation URL back to
//!                     the 3rd party which then should respond with a success acknowledging the confirmation.
//!                     testing url: POST [https://sandbox.safaricom.co.ke/mpesa/c2b/v1/registerurl](#)
//!                    
//!  ****Note: The 3rd party resource URLs for both confirmation and validation must be HTTPS in production. Validation is an optional feature that needs to be activated on M-Pesa, the owner of the shortcode needs to make this request for activation.****
//! 
//! * **Simulate Transaction** - The simulates transaction initiates a simulated transaction from the customers end
//!
